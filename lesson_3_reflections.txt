When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans:
Whenever i want to share my progress or work.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans:
Remote might have some features added or subtracted which i may or maynot want.
So it's better if i have power to choose what i want and what i don't.
