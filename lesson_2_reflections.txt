What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Ans:
A new folder .git is created which is supposed to track changes done in files in the directory where it is initialized.
It is needed because git might have its own config for it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Ans:
Staging area lets add subset of files that is needed to be tracked.
It allows user to custom add files which they needed to keep track at a moment.
